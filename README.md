ðŸ§  MyJournal: Your AI-Powered App for Mental Strength

Project Overview

"MyJournal" is an innovative, AI-powered web application (planned as a cross-platform app) that supports young people in building emotional structure, clarity, and mental strength. At its core, it is a personal self-reflection tool with a strong focus on rational problem-solving, personal responsibility, and sustainable personal development.

The app was developed to provide users with a safe and private space to process their thoughts and feelings, supported by intelligent technologies that encourage self-help.

My Mission
In a rapidly changing world, we want to provide young people with a tool that helps them understand their inner world, recognize patterns, and proactively work on their well-being. We believe in the power of reflection and the support of technology to promote personal responsibility for one's own happiness.

Core Features
Intuitive Journaling: Users can record their thoughts, feelings, and experiences daily. The journal entries are structured (e.g., "Feelings today," "What went well," "Gratitude," "Challenges," "Learning moments") and can optionally be supplemented with flowing text and tags. The data is presented in a clear, Notion-like table view.

AI-supported reflection (future): Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to provide users with personalized feedback, ask targeted questions, and offer rational solutions to identified issues (e.g., stress, self-esteem, procrastination). The AI â€‹â€‹will act empathetically and based on the journal's previous history to maintain context.

Mood tracking & visualization (planned): Ability to capture daily mood and visualize this development over days or weeks in clear charts (e.g., line charts) to reveal patterns and progress.

Interactive tools: A collection of proven self-help exercises and strategies, such as guided breathing exercises (e.g., the 4-7-8 technique), that support physical and mental well-being.

Secure chat area (future): A private space for communicating with the AI â€‹â€‹or processing thoughts in a chat format.

Comprehensive privacy: Focus on the possibility of local data storage (browser localStorage) for maximum privacy, with optional cross-device synchronization via a privacy-compliant backend solution (planned).

User registration: Enables the management of user profiles and personalized settings.

Onboarding tour: An interactive guide for new users to learn about the app's features and benefits.

Appealing & clean design: A minimalist and intuitive user interface that creates a pleasant atmosphere through Tailwind CSS and a carefully selected color palette. Including dark mode.

Technical stack (frontend)
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast build tool that enables a seamless development experience.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for fast and consistent styling.

TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that results in more robust and maintainable code.

recharts (planned): A chart library for data visualization.

Future Plans
Backend Development: Implementation of a secure backend infrastructure for AI integration (API calls to LLMs) and cross-device data synchronization (under strict privacy policies).

Advanced AI Features: In-depth analysis of journal entries, personalized strategy recommendations, and context-sensitive interactions.

Mobile App Publishing: Transforming the web application into native mobile apps for iOS and Android (e.g., using React Native) to ensure maximum accessibility.

How to get started (for developers)
If you want to run the project locally:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x

Change to the project directory: cd mentales-journal (or whatever your repo name is)

Install the dependencies: npm install

Start the development server: npm run dev

Your project should now be available in the browser at http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port).
